            <h2>Launch flow</h2>
            <p>
              A creator submits a fixed-supply token launch through the reviewed factory. The curve
              phase accepts buys and sells, and the selected wallet signs every transaction. After
              graduation, the route moves to the reviewed Uniswap v2 pair.
            </p>
            <p>
              Launchpad reads indexed state from the API and uses RPC for live quotes, simulation,
              and wallet writes. Mined is not the same as indexed, safe, or finalized.
            </p>

            <h2>Curve and graduation</h2>
            <p>
              V1 uses a 1,000,000,000 token total supply: 800,000,000 tokens are allocated to the
              curve and 200,000,000 to the post-graduation liquidity position. Graduation occurs at
              4.2 ETH of real curve ETH. The initial LP position is burned after routing to the
              Uniswap v2 pool.
            </p>
            <p>
              These are protocol parameters, not a promise that a token will graduate, retain
              liquidity, or produce a return.

              Quotes are informational until the contract simulation and signed transaction execute.
              Slippage, deadlines, gas, and refunds must be reviewed in the wallet.

            <h2>Risks and non-custody</h2>
            <p>
              Launchpad never takes custody of ETH or tokens. A wallet signature authorizes an
              on-chain transaction; it does not guarantee inclusion or finality. Smart-contract
              bugs, reorgs, RPC failures, malicious metadata, price volatility, loss of keys, and
              irreversible transfers are possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do not treat market-cap, volume, liquidity, or graduation indicators as investment
              advice or a promise of liquidity or returns. Verify the chain, contract address,
              calldata, minimum output, fee, deadline, and recipient before signing.
            </p>

            <h2>Contracts and finality</h2>
            <p>
              Indexed reads are bound to a canonical chain snapshot with block number, block hash,
              and a finality label. Reorgs can invalidate a cursor or replace derived values; the
              API then requires a fresh snapshot.
